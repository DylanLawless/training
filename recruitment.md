- Will do (ambiotions)

### Get the info you need

- Exaplain the interview process.
- Verify specific details: can do, will do, fit.
- Avoid direct, closed Qs like "do you like X?", or reciting their CV.
- Help them to show who they are. Don't ask  broad career Qs, you are leading so it up to you to start. But do not have leading Qs that infer the answer.

	+ Is there anything that you have not mentioned that we should know?
* Aspirations and contributions
	+ What do you think you can contribute?

* Last Q to ask yourself before they leave
	+ Suitable: leave them with no doubts, sell position by their aspirations, 20 min., another interview, etc.
	+ Not suitable: tell them why frankly.
