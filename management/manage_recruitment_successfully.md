- Will do (ambitions)

#### Get the info you need

- Explain the interview process.
- Verify specific details: can do, will do, fit.
- Avoid direct, closed Qs like "do you like X?", or reciting their CV.

* Module summary:
	+ Don't tell, ask
	+ Asking questions
	+ Rephrasing
	+ Preparing the wording for giving feedback
	+ Preparing the wording of a request

### Don't tell, ask
Instead of trying to solve others' problem,
staff may already have a solution or idea that is ideal.
Ask them first.

* Take the other person's perspective while learning their reasoning.
* Ask Qs until you understand their point of view.

### Asking questions
* Closed Q for gathering info
* Closed Q for making suggestions
	+ Closed Qs will require short answers that cannot fully relate the important points.
	+ They deal with facts.
	+ Pro: Fast, structured.
	+ Con: Not giving the other person time to make their points causes interrogation and poor dialogue.

* Open Qs
	+ Developing Qs allow the person to expand: How so, for example, based on what criteria?
	+ They involve the other person and create trust.
	+ Can evaluate how solid the reasoning is.
	+ Cons: They can cause waffling and not leading the meeting.

* Right Q at right time.

### Rephrasing
* Focus on main issue
* Use own words
* Summarise and recap
* Don't repeat everything - irritating
* To successfully summarise: Adapt to the needs of the other person

* It is not to confirm what the other person in saying
* It is to focus and summarise, make a shared simple points of agreement.
* Avoids misunderstanding.

Rephrase to:
	- Clarify for confusion
	- focus for off-topic
	- summarise for too many details
	- convert for non-verbal signals
	- address a process for a struggling group

### Preparing the wording for giving feedback
Use these to guide feedback

1. Feedback theme:
2. Obj 1: Identify an observable situation. Be specific.
3. Obj 2: Give tangible proof of what you want to pinpoint. Be factual.
4. Obj 3: Make the impact on performance explicit. Criticize work but not their person.

### Preparing the wording of a request

Formulate your request:

* Have you worded your request in the 1st person? 
* Have you justified your request?
	- Say why you need what it is you are requesting.
* Have you personalised your request?
	- Explain why you are addressing your interlocutor.
* Remember to respect your interlocutorâ€™s freedom of expression.
	- Your interlocutor has the right to say no to your request, so be careful of the tone you use to address him/her.

Rephrase your request:
